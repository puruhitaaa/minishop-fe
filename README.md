# minishop-fe

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Start, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Start** - SSR framework with TanStack Router
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.

## Demo admin access

For testing `/admin` (products, orders), use this bearer token. Paste it on [http://localhost:3001/admin](http://localhost:3001/admin) (session storage only; cleared when the tab closes).

```

```

Backend `INTERNAL_KEY` must match this value. Set `VITE_SERVER_URL` to your API origin (see `apps/web/.env.example`).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@minishop-fe/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `pnpm run check`
